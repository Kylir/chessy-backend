# Chessy (backend)

DISCLAIMER: I know nothing about Chess! And I am an extremely bad player.
By doing this little app I hope it will help me to improve.

This is a very dummy chess position analyser back-end written in NodeJS.

## Principle

The idea is to provide a chess board configuration, who's turn it is and the program will provide a dummy analysis of good and bad moves.
This analysis will be based on very simple concepts like: is the piece in danger after the move, is there an oponent's piece to capture, and so on.
There will be absolutely no intelligence and no long-term prediction.
